                <p>Graduates specialize in the design and development of all aspects of software and hardware systems; their work is concerned with information processing through the structuring, representation, transformation and transmission of information. The fundamentals of this major include programming systems and languages, computer architecture, data structures, operating systems, databases, computer networks, analysis and design of algorithms, theory of computation, software engineering, embedded systems, computer graphics, microprocessors, artificial intelligence, distributed systems, compilers, real time systems, augmented reality and computer security.</p>

                <div class="br"></div>
                <p> Computer scientists work as theorists, researchers, or inventors. Their jobs are distinguished by the higher level of theoretical expertise and innovation they apply to complex problems and the creation or application of new technology. Those employed by academic institutions work in areas ranging from complexity theory to hardware to programming-language design. Some work on multidisciplinary projects, such as developing and advancing uses of virtual reality, extending human-computer interaction, or designing robots. Their counterparts in private industry work in areas such as applying theory; developing specialized languages or information technologies; or designing programming tools, knowledge-based systems, or even computer games.</p>

                <div class="br"></div>
                <p>Database administrators work with database management systems software and determine ways to organize and store data. They identify user requirements, set up computer databases, and test and coordinate modifications to the computer database systems. An organizationâ€™s database administrator ensures the performance of the system, understands the platform on which the database runs, and adds new users to the system. Because they also may design and implement system security, database administrators often plan and coordinate security measures. With the volume of sensitive data generated every second growing rapidly, data integrity, backup systems, and database security have become increasingly important aspects of the job of database administrators.</p>

                <p> Computer (or application) programmers (or software developers) write, test, and maintain the detailed instructions, called programs that computers must follow to perform their functions. Programmers also conceive, design, and test logical structures for solving problems by computer. Many technical innovations in programmingâ€”advanced computing technologies and sophisticated new languages and programming toolsâ€”have redefined the role of a programmer and elevated much of the programming work done today. Job titles and descriptions may vary, depending on the organization.</p>

                <p>Computer software engineers apply the principles and techniques of computer science, engineering, and mathematical analysis to the design, development, testing, and evaluation of the software and systems that enable computers to perform their many applications. Software engineers working in applications or systems development analyze usersâ€™ needs and design, construct, test, and maintain computer applications software or systems. Software engineers can be involved in the design and development of many types of software, including software for operating systems and network distribution, and compilers, which convert programs for execution on a computer. In programming, or coding, software engineers instruct a computer, line by line, how to perform a function. They also solve technical problems that arise. Software engineers must possess strong programming skills, but are more concerned with developing algorithms and analyzing and solving programming problems than with actually writing code.</p>
